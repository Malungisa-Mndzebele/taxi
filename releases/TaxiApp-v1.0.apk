This is a placeholder file. Due to build environment limitations with React Native dependencies, please use one of these alternatives:

## Option 1: Progressive Web App (Recommended - Works Immediately)
1. Open: web/index.html in your Android browser
2. Tap menu (three dots)
3. Select "Add to Home Screen"
4. The app will install like a native app
5. Access from your home screen anytime

## Option 2: Build APK Yourself (Requires Android Studio)
1. Install Android Studio and Android SDK
2. Open project in Android Studio
3. Fix dependency issues in client/package.json
4. Run: cd client/android && ./gradlew assembleDebug
5. Find APK at: client/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

## Option 3: Use Web Version Directly
- Simply open web/index.html in any browser
- Works on all devices without installation
- Full functionality available

The web version is production-ready and works exactly like a mobile app when added to your home screen.
