This is the **fastest and easiest** way to install:

1. **On Your Android Phone:**
   - Open Chrome browser
   - Go to the repository: https://github.com/Malungisa-Mndzebele/taxi
   - Navigate to: `releases/download-android.html`
   - OR directly open: `web/index.html`

2. **Install to Home Screen:**
   - Tap the menu button (⋮) in Chrome
   - Select "Add to Home Screen"
   - Name it "Taxi App"
   - Tap "Add"

3. **Launch:**
   - Find the "Taxi App" icon on your home screen
   - Tap to open - it works exactly like a native app!

### Why PWA is Best:

- ✅ **Instant**: No build or compilation needed
- ✅ **Small**: No large APK download
- ✅ **Updated**: Always get latest features automatically
- ✅ **Offline**: Works without internet (cached)
- ✅ **Full-Screen**: No browser UI, feels native
- ✅ **Fast**: Cached for speed
- ✅ **Secure**: No "unknown sources" needed

## 📱 Alternative: Build Native APK

If you need a traditional APK file:

1. **Requirements:**
   - Android Studio
   - Android SDK (API 34)
   - Java JDK 11+

2. **Build:**
   ```bash
   cd client/android
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

3. **Find APK:**
   - Location: `client/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
   - Transfer to phone and install

**Note:** Native APK build has dependency conflicts that need manual fixing. PWA is recommended for easier installation.
