# üîç Deployment Troubleshooting

## ‚ùå Issue: Taxi App Not Showing at https://khasinogaming.com/app/

**Current Status:** Website shows a card game instead of taxi app

---

## üéØ Most Likely Causes

### 1. GitHub Secret Not Added (Most Common)

**Problem:** You pushed the code but didn't add the FTP_PASSWORD secret

**Check:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Malungisa-Mndzebele/taxi/settings/secrets/actions
2. Do you see `FTP_PASSWORD` listed?
3. If NO ‚Üí This is the problem!

**Fix:**
1. Click "New repository secret"
2. Name: `FTP_PASSWORD`
3. Secret: `@QWERTYasd`
4. Click "Add secret"
5. Then re-run deployment

---

### 2. Deployment Failed

**Check:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/Malungisa-Mndzebele/taxi/actions
2. Look at the latest workflow run
3. Is it ‚ùå Red (failed) or ‚úÖ Green (success)?

**If Red (Failed):**
- Click on the failed run
- Look at the error message
- Most likely: "FTP_PASSWORD secret not found"

**If Green (Success):**
- Files were uploaded
- Check if path is correct (see below)

---

### 3. Wrong Deployment Path

**Problem:** Files went to wrong directory

**Current Path in Workflow:**
```
/home/mawdqtvped/khasinogaming.com/app/
```

**Possible Issues:**
- Files might be in subfolder
- Need to overwrite existing game files
- Path might need adjustment

## ‚úÖ Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secret (If Not Done)

```
1. Go to: https://github.com/Malungisa-Mndzebele/taxi/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click: "New repository secret"
3. Name: FTP_PASSWORD
4. Secret: @QWERTYasd
5. Click: "Add secret"
```

### Step 2: Trigger Manual Deployment

Since automatic deployment might have failed, trigger it manually:

```
1. Go to: https://github.com/Malungisa-Mndzebele/taxi/actions
2. Click: "Full Deploy to Hosting" (left sidebar)
3. Click: "Run workflow" (right side)
4. Select: "web-only"
5. Click: "Run workflow"
6. Wait 2-3 minutes
7. Refresh: https://khasinogaming.com/app/
```

### Step 3: Verify Files via FTP

Use FTP client to check:

**FTP Details:**
- Server: server28.shared.spaceship.host
- Username: app@khasinogaming.com
- Password: @QWERTYasd
- Path: /home/mawdqtvped/khasinogaming.com/app/

**Expected Files:**
- index.html (your taxi app)
- manifest.json
- sw.js
- icon-192.png
- icon-512.png

## üîß Alternative: Manual FTP Upload

If GitHub Actions isn't working, upload manually:

### Option 1: FileZilla (Recommended)

1. **Download FileZilla:** https://filezilla-project.org/
2. **Connect:**
   - Host: server28.shared.spaceship.host
   - Username: app@khasinogaming.com
   - Password: @QWERTYasd
   - Port: 21
3. **Navigate to:** /home/mawdqtvped/khasinogaming.com/app/
4. **Upload files from:** `web/` folder
5. **Overwrite** existing files when prompted

### Option 2: Command Line FTP

```bash
# Windows
ftp server28.shared.spaceship.host
# Login: app@khasinogaming.com
# Password: @QWERTYasd
cd /home/mawdqtvped/khasinogaming.com/app/
put web/index.html
put web/manifest.json
put web/sw.js
# etc...
```

## üéØ Updated Workflow (If Path Wrong)

If the current game needs to be in a different folder:

### Option A: Deploy to Subfolder

**Change workflow path to:**
```yaml
server-dir: /home/mawdqtvped/khasinogaming.com/app/taxi/
```

**Your app will be at:**
https://khasinogaming.com/app/taxi/

### Option B: Replace Game

**Keep current path, just overwrite:**
```yaml
server-dir: /home/mawdqtvped/khasinogaming.com/app/
```

**Your app will replace game:**
https://khasinogaming.com/app/
